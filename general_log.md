# General Development Log - Harmonic Percolator Project

## 27-10-2025
### Introduction
This is the first entry into my 'General Development Log' for the harmonic percolator pedal I am building. I aim to produce a unique harmonic percolator pedal and learn all about effect pedal theory and construction by practice.
### Undocumented Progress
This project began in summer 2024, when I decided to delve into my passion for guitar pedals and learn how they tick. I started by watching a few of 'Landertronics' youtube videos to explain amplifiers and BJTs, commonly found in effects pedals. I quickly learned without a practical example, I had no intuitive connections to real-world applications. So, I decided to build a harmonic percolator as a case study, chosen mainly because I couldn't afford a commercial one. 
Up to this point I had learned basic electronic theory from my laboratory classes in my physics degree. I also could solder adequately, having replaced a faulty switch on a recently purchased Jekyll & Hyde overdrive distortion pedal. Next, I found a harmonic percolator circuit: "https://www.madbeanpedals.com/projects/_folders/1590A/pdf/PepperSpray2019.pdf", bought the components and a breadboarding starter kit and began to build. I was satisfied with the sound of the breadboarded circuit and decided to commit to the design. I constructed the circuit on Kicad and familiarised myself with the basics of LtSpice. I followed youtube to construct a pcb and ordered five copies. As of the end of autumn 2024 I had a working prototype of my 'Many Faces' harmonic percolator.
I achieve the high end tone I want, but the sound is spluttery and quiet in the low end. I was frustrated as to why, so I decided to learn more about the theory behind effects pedals in a hope to be able to find and resolve the cause of the issue. From the autumn of 2024 to the summer of 2025 I was completing my final year of my physics degree, so I had no time to really research effects pedals. Interestingly, I did my dissertation on the design of a tuning device for a musical instrument, learning signal processing and DSP theory.
Since graduation I have been following Sedra & Smiths Microelectronic Circuits to learn about BJTs and amplifier architecture, once I reach amplifiers with collector feedback I will have learned all parts of the harmonic percolator circuit. From which, I can experiment with parameters such as transistor biases and coupling/decoupling capacitor values. My progress up until this point is saved in the repository under MF-v1.

### Progress Update
Over the past few months I have become comfortable with BJT biasing, small-signal analysis, single-stage amplifiers and shunt-shunt feedback - all topics I have learned by following the examples and problems in Sedra & Smith. Paired with an LTSpice schematic of my V1 Many Faces harmonic percolator, I learned visually what happens to a sine waveform when incident on the common emitter amplifiers in the harmonic percolator topology, and when each transistor is driven into saturation or cutoff. My notes on this can be found in the Notion file: https://www.notion.so/Electronics-Notes-26a27d91a6fe80558542cc7c8c5bb23a?source=copy_link. 

### Next Steps
The next stage of pedal design will be an experimental phase. I have acquired a DI signal of clean guitar in a .wav file from my audio engineer friend, and will send this through my LTSpice harmonic percolator circuit as the voltage input. The output voltage will be recorded as a second .wav file, from which I can audibly inspect the effect of the circuit on a typical guitar signal. Futher, a transient analysis of the waveforms will be recorded in LTSPice which enables possible Fourier analyses. The experiments I'd like to focus on are effect of an input buffer (pickup simulator), filters before/after each transistor stage (inclduing effect of changing feedback resistor) and different types of clipping circuits.
