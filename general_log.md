# General Development Log - Harmonic Percolator Project

## 27-10-2025
### Introduction
This is the first entry into my 'General Development Log' for the harmonic percolator pedal I am building. I aim to produce a unique harmonic percolator pedal and learn all about effect pedal theory and construction by practice.
### Undocumented Progress
This project began in summer 2024, when I decided to delve into my passion for guitar pedals and learn how they tick. I started by watching a few of 'Landertronics' youtube videos to explain amplifiers and BJTs, commonly found in effects pedals. I quickly learned without a practical example, I had no intuitive connections to real-world applications. So, I decided to build a harmonic percolator as a case study, chosen mainly because I couldn't afford a commercial one. 
Up to this point I had learned basic electronic theory from my laboratory classes in my physics degree. I also could solder adequately, having replaced a faulty switch on a recently purchased Jekyll & Hyde overdrive distortion pedal. Next, I found a harmonic percolator circuit: "https://www.madbeanpedals.com/projects/_folders/1590A/pdf/PepperSpray2019.pdf", bought the components and a breadboarding starter kit and began to build. I was satisfied with the sound of the breadboarded circuit and decided to commit to the design. I constructed the circuit on Kicad and familiarised myself with the basics of LtSpice. I followed youtube to construct a pcb and ordered five copies. As of the end of autumn 2024 I had a working prototype of my 'Many Faces' harmonic percolator.
I achieve the high end tone I want, but the sound is spluttery and quiet in the low end. I was frustrated as to why, so I decided to learn more about the theory behind effects pedals in a hope to be able to find and resolve the cause of the issue. From the autumn of 2024 to the summer of 2025 I was completing my final year of my physics degree, so I had no time to really research effects pedals. Interestingly, I did my dissertation on the design of a tuning device for a musical instrument, learning signal processing and DSP theory.
Since graduation I have been following Sedra & Smiths Microelectronic Circuits to learn about BJTs and amplifier architecture, once I reach amplifiers with collector feedback I will have learned all parts of the harmonic percolator circuit. From which, I can experiment with parameters such as transistor biases and coupling/decoupling capacitor values. My progress up until this point is saved in the repository under MF-v1.
